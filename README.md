NBA Player Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the Python code for my applied project, which analyzes NBA player data.

Files:

- NBA.py: Main script for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

Features:

The script performs the following:

- Data cleaning (removing missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns)
- Basic analysis of player attributes and statistics
- Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and pyecharts

Expected visualizations include:

- Salary distribution histograms
- Position-based average salary analysis
- BMI calculations
- Player number distribution
- Word cloud based on player positions


To run the code:

1. Install the required Python libraries.
2. Run NBA.py using Python 3.
3. The visualizations will be saved as HTML or PNG files.
